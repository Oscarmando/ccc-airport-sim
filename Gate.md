We'll have an array list of the flights, this will give each flight a number and name.
Then we'll have  an if statement to check if the flight has arrived or not. if it has, then a timer will start to act as the layover time. The timer will end and start the next departure for that flight.

Gate should be able to detect a flight by the certain number it is given and be able to restrict it from leaving for the allotted amount of time that it needs to be emptied and boarded and refueled.
